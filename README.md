# Simple Todo App
This Project/app is meant to make a project deadline board, now lets go more in depth in what I mean by that. This app is meant to help you keep yourself to certain deadlines and gently remind you of what you have to get done for the day or week. All you have to do is simply add your List of things todo for as far out as you wish and check them off as you go.

## Functionality

This app allows you to add as many items you need to get done as you want to help you keep track of what needs to get accomplished. Some people use a calendar and then what ever is on it for that day they add that to there TODO board and check it off one by one. People find it easier to do this as it gives them a sense of accomplishment when they check something off and helps their day go by faster. 

## Technology
In this app we have used mostly java script to program how this works, now sometimes people use just the one Java Script file and do everything that way but as seen here............. We broke it up into several to make it easier to edit the backend code to change or alter  the way the website works.
